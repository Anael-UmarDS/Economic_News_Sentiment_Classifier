# Economic_News_Sentiment_Classifier
This project pulls real-time economic headlines from NewsAPI and automatically labels them using VADER sentiment analysis. It then trains a logistic regression classifier to categorize future headlines as positive, neutral, or negative. The final output includes evaluation metrics and trend plots to visualize sentiment shifts over time.
